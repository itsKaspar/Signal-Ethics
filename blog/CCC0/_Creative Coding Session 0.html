<h3>Drawing Shapes</h3>

<p>To draw shapes inside a sketch, you can can call shape functions such as circle(), rect() and triangle() and line()</p>

<tiny-code>function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw(){
  let x = 100;
  let y = 100;
  let diameter = 100;
  circle(x,y,diameter);
  noLoop();
}</tiny-code>

<p>You can place shapes absolutely by giving them an exact x and y coordinate,
but you can also place them relatively to the sketch's width and height global variables. This can be practical
to center shapes even if you decide to resize your sketch in the future</p>

<tiny-code>function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw(){
  circle(width/2,height/2,100);
  noLoop();
}</tiny-code>

<p>Some other intersting global variable are the ones that store your mouse's x and y position,
you can call them using mouseX and mouseY
</p>

<tiny-code style="height:210px">function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw(){
  background('white');
  circle(mouseX,mouseY,100);
}</tiny-code>

<h3> Placing shapes in sketch proportions</h3>

<p>We've seen how we could place a shape in the center by dividing width and height by 2, to place a shape at 25% or at 75% of the sketch
  we can apply the same principle</P>

  <tiny-code style="height:210px">function setup() {
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
    rectMode(CENTER);
  }

  function draw(){
    circle(width*0.25,height*0.5,100);
    rect(width*0.75,height*0.5,100,100);
    noLoop();
  }</tiny-code>




<h3>Vectors</h3>

<p>
We've learned to place things in space by defining x and y variables, but when handling hundreds of items it will become pretty tedious to have two separate variables for each of our placed shapes.
To solve this we need a type of variable that can contain both the x and the y coordinate.</p>

<p>For this reason I'd like to introduce vector notation. Though vectors mean different things in maths, physics and computer science,
in creative coding, a vector refers to a specific data structure which we call objects, more specifically a vector is an object which holds two values :
one x-coordinate and one y-coordinate.</p>

<p>In creative coding this can be assimilated to a point in space.</p>

<p>If we were to create a vector called v and look inside it, it would look like this</p>

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>attribute of v</th><th>value</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>v.x</td><td>holds the x-coordinate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>v.y</td><td>holds the y-coordinate</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Let's write the same code from above but with vector notation :</p>

<tiny-code style="height:290px">function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw(){
  let v = createVector(width/2, height/2);
  // creates a vector with
  // v.x = width / 2
  // v.y = height / 2

  let diameter = 100;
  circle(v.x, v.y, diameter);
  noLoop();
}</tiny-code>

<p>The x and y values of our vector object can be accessed with what is called <strong>dot notation</strong>.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Reverse-engineer and then reproduce the following code using vectors.</p>

<tiny-code layout="visual" style="height:500px">
function setup() {
createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
  clear();

  let padding = 100;

  let v1 = createVector(0 + padding,0 + padding);
  let v2 = createVector(width-padding,0 + padding);
  let v3 = createVector(width-padding,height-padding)
  let v4 = createVector(0 + padding, height-padding);

  //stroke('white');
  noFill();

  // fill(mouseY);
  triangle(v1.x, v1.y, v2.x, v2.y, mouseX, mouseY);

  // fill(width-mouseX);
  triangle(v2.x, v2.y, v3.x, v3.y, mouseX, mouseY);

  // fill(height-mouseY);
  triangle(v3.x, v3.y, v4.x, v4.y, mouseX, mouseY);

  // fill(mouseX);
  triangle(v4.x, v4.y, v1.x, v1.y, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</tiny-code>

<p>Here are some common questions that you could ask yourself :</p>

<ol>
  <li>List the geometric shapes that you can see</li>
  <li>List the endpoints of every shape, how many are there ?</li>
  <li>Are some endpoints shared ? How many endpoints really exist ?</li>
  <li>How many of these are fixed ? How many are moving ?</li>
</ol>
