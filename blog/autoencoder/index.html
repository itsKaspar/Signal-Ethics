  <p>
  This autoencoder takes an image of a hand-written digit and squeezes it into fewer dimensions,
  a latent space, composed of trained parameters from which any of the handwritten digits are theoretically
  reproducable back to their higher dimensional representation. The first line you can see here is the AE in action with its input and output.
  </p>

  <p>
  The second line is the decoder part of the AE. Giving you directly access to the parameters of the latent space.
  By toying around with these you can decode your own shapes into higher dimensions with the same training set that the first line uses.
  </p>

  <p>
  The third line is the encoder part of the AE, with its inputs on one side, and on the other,
  a 2D flattened representation of the latent space using the t-SNE algorithm. As such the color
  patches that you can see correspond to the input colors of digits 1 through 9.
